# jSnake
jSnake is a version of the classic 'Snake' game.
The objective of the game is to eat as many apples as possible, 
while avoiding collision with yourself or the borders. 
The game was assigned as coursework for the MYP Grade 10
Computer Science course, which is taught in Java.
The graphical user interface was created using the built-in Swing library.

### Usage
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/karmdesai/jSnake.git
$ cd jSnake
$ cd src
$ javac JSnake.java
$ java JSnake
```
You can start playing the game after those commands are run.

**If you run into any issues (or want a better playing experience), consider
using a Java IDE like BlueJ.**
